# Contributing

We welcome contributions, however before submitting any changes, create an issue on github so we can discuss your ideas, bugs etc. That way we all avoid wasting effort.

We make extensive use of Spring4D for Dependency Injection and collections. Make sure you are up to speed with DI and use it where possible.
