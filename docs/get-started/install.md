# Installing DPM

DPM currently only has a command-line interface. You can find the latest version under [Releases](https://github.com/DelphiPackageManager/DPM/releases) on the GitHub page.

We recommend you add the folder you extract it into, to the system path as this will make working with it easier.

The dpm cli is [documented here](../commands.md). You can also get help using

```cli
dpm help <command>
```
