The .dspec files in this folder are so you can build packages for the third party libs we use which do not currently publish packages. 

We will work with the authors to get packages published in the future, once we are close to a 1.0 release.

Ahausladen.JsonDataObjects - https://github.com/ahausladen/JsonDataObjects

Spring4D.Core, Spring4D.Base, Spring4D.Extensions - https://bitbucket.org/sglienke/spring4d/src/develop/

Gabr42.OmniThreadLibrary - https://github.com/gabr42/OmniThreadLibrary

The dspec files for these are all available in their repositories - https://github.com/VSoftTechnologies
We also publish packages for these under releases.
